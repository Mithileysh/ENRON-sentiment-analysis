The Withdrawal Plan indicates  the  maximum\nrecommended storage withdrawals for each of four (4) withdrawal  periods\nand  is  designed to reflect in the aggregate Texas Eastern's historical\nutilization of its storage facilities prior to the implementation of the\nCommission's Order No. 636\n\nTexas Eastern is not issuing a Customer-Specific OFO at this time due to\nthe  high  aggregate storage position at 12/31/2001.
